    This function should sample the given sequences to account for class imbalance.

            List of all sequences.

        sampled_seqs: List[str]

def one_hot_encode_seqs(seq_arr: List[str]) -> ArrayLike:
    """
    This function generates a flattened one-hot encoding of a list of DNA sequences
    for use as input into a neural network.

    Args:
        seq_arr: List[str]
            List of sequences to encode.

    Returns:
        encodings: ArrayLike
            Array of encoded sequences, with each encoding 4x as long as the input sequence.
            For example, if we encode:
                A -> [1, 0, 0, 0]
                T -> [0, 1, 0, 0]
